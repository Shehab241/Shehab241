Hi ðŸ‘‹, Nice to see you.

I am a web developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different front end and back end languages. My objective is simply to be the best web developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. While a student at university, I studied Mathematics, and I believe that my understanding of problem solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer.
